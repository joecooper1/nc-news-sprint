### The is my NC NEWS backend project files.

It is a basic reddit-style forum site, with user-made content, votes, comments and a favouriting system.

The backend of this project can be found on github here: https://github.com/joecooper1/nc-news-frontend

And it's hosted on heroku here https://nc-be-database.herokuapp.com/ (add 'api' to endpoint to see list of possible endpoints)

It requires node v13.2.0 or newer to run.

To run this project locally:

> git clone https://github.com/joecooper1/nc-news-sprint.git
